A regular polygon is a polygon that is equiangular and equilateral. 
This means that all its angles are the same measure and all its sides are the same length. 
The most basic example of a regular polygon is an equilateral triangle, 
a triangle with three congruent sides and three congruent angles. Squares are also regular polygons, because all their angles are the 
same (90∘) and all their sides are the same length. Regular polygons with five or more sides do not have special names. Instead, 
the word regular is used to describe them. For example, a regular hexagon is a hexagon (6 sided polygon) whose angles are all the same 
measure and sides are all the same length.
All regular polygons have rotation symmetry. This means that a rotation of less than 360∘ will carry the regular polygon onto itself. 
In fact, a regular n-sided polygon has rotation symmetry for any multiple of 360∘ / n.

equations to get the verteces :
#x = (cos((2 * pi*(i / (numOfSides * 1.0))) + (2 * pi*(1 / (numOfSides*1.0))) / 2));
#y = (sin((2 * pi*(i / (numOfSides * 1.0))) + (2 * pi*(1 / (numOfSides*1.0))) / 2));
